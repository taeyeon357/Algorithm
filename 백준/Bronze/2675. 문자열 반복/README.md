### 문제 설명

<p>For this problem, you will write a program that takes a string of characters, S, and creates a new string of characters, T, with each character repeated R times. That is, R copies of the first character of S, followed by R copies of the second character of S, and so on. Valid characters for S are the QR Code "alphanumeric" characters:</p>

<pre>0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ$%*+-./:</pre>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of input contains a single integer P, ( 1 ≤ P ≤ 1000), which is the number of data sets that follow. Each data set is a single line of input consisting of the data set number N, followed by a space, followed by the repeat count R, ( 1 ≤ R ≤ 8), followed by a space, followed by the string S. The length of string S will always be at least one and no more than 20 characters. All the characters will be from the set of characters shown above.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each data set there is one line of output. It contains the data set number, N, followed by a single space which is then followed by the new string T, which is made of each character in S repeated R times.</p>
